## Docker Details

This application uses a multi-stage Docker build:

1. **Builder Stage**: Uses Node.js 24 Alpine to install dependencies and build the Angular application
2. **Runtime Stage**: Uses Nginx Alpine to serve the built application

The Docker setup includes:
- `Dockerfile`: Multi-stage build configuration
- `nginx.conf`: Nginx configuration for serving the Angular app
- `entrypoint.sh`: Runtime configuration script

### Docker Environment Variables

The application supports runtime configuration through environment variables. The `entrypoint.sh` script processes `configuration.template.js` to generate the final configuration at runtime.
